\section{Mint and redeem}

%If there is positive DAI balance in the collateral, USSD contract can provide DAI for equal 
%amount of USSD in return (that would be burned, contracting supply).

At any given time, USSD can be minted using DAI as collateral at 1-to-1 ratio, expanding 
total USSD supply. This also can expand supply with larger amounts than current pool liquidity
(so that USSD could be minted with no slippage).

Ability to mint USSD for DAI could serve as incentive to rebalance the coin 
when this is economically viable (covering the gas expenses). However, providing ability 
to mint or redeem USSD for collateral other than DAI (to which it aims to be pegged) 
could be exploited as getting a directional exposure to the collateral component 
(e.g. mint for WETH and then redeem for WETH later would lead to profiting from short 
exposure if WETH price decreases).

To help USSD recover in negative scenarios (if USSD value 
falls below 1 DAI and there are less than 1 USD/DAI reserves per USSD): to refill the reserves 
by directly providing collateral to the USSD contract's address (at the expense of the agent 
performing that), and then triggering rebalance (optional) to reduce supply and repeg.

From the other side, implementing a redeeming method (e.g. redeem DAI for USSD) would de-incentivize 
calling rebalance, with more speculative arbitrage exposed, so direct redeem function is not included
in the initial implementation of USSD.
