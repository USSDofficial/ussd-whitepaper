\section{Mint and redeem}

If there is positive DAI balance in the collateral, USSD contract can provide DAI for equal 
amount of USSD in return (that would be burned, contracting supply).

At any given time, USSD can be minted using DAI as collateral at 1-to-1 ratio, expanding 
total USSD supply.

Ability to mint and redeem USSD for DAI could serve as incentives to rebalance the coin 
when this is economically viable (covering the gas expenses). However, providing ability 
to mint or redeem USSD for collateral other than DAI (to which it aims to be pegged) 
could be exploited as getting a directional exposure to the collateral component 
(e.g. mint for WETH and then redeem for WETH later would lead to profiting from short 
exposure if WETH price decreases).

These methods also could be used to help USSD recover in negative scenarios: if USSD value 
falls below 1 DAI and there are less than 1 DAI reserves per USSD to refill the reserves 
allowing the USSD to recover it's price by reducing supply (at the expense of the agent 
performing that).
