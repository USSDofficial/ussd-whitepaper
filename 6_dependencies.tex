\section{Dependencies and deployment}

This is a list of dependencies the USSD smart contract has for its implementation
and functioning:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item OpenZeppelin contracts-upgradeable library\textsuperscript{5}, that is 
  thoroughly audited and widely used implementation of various useful libraries for 
  access management, transparent proxy pattern and others. To reserve ability to 
  patch possible bugs, the contract would be kept upgradeable (for a limited time, 
  and then locked afterwards). There are two roles initially defined: one is standard
  DEFAULT\_ADMIN role for managing upgradeability, and second is STABLE\_CONTROL role,
  for managing collateral and several numerical parameters (rebalance minimal threshold,
  flutter ratios).
  \item DAI stablecoin contract\textsuperscript{6}, as     
       DAI is used as part of the collateral, and USSD tries to maintain its peg for DAI
       through Uniswap V3 pool rebalancing.
  \item Uniswap V3 (universal V3 router\textsuperscript{7} and pool contracts)
       Uniswap is used extensively by USSD to measure peg, collateral ratio, 
       perform collateral buying and selling using swap routes (sometimes 2 or 3 pools
       in a swap chain). The pool swap path can be administered
\end{enumerate}

Contracts for the USSD ERC20 token were deployed in two EVM-compatible blockchains:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ethereum Mainnet (chain id 1): contract address \newline
0x97D87327D8F168b0Ba317fd8B210d2B087f4b851;
  \item BNB Chain (chain id 56): 0x19a23fEA27B1d845a334DFAADb5e54FAd7cdcE74. In addition, as DAI liquidity
for BNB chain on Uniswap is not sufficient for USSD operation, USDT was used as a substitute (that may be changed
in the future for the purposes described earlier).
\end{enumerate}
