\section{Dependencies}

This is a list of dependencies the USSD smart contract has for its implementation
and functioning:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item OpenZeppelin contracts-upgradeable library\textsuperscript{5}, that is 
  thoroughly audited and widely used implementation of various useful libraries for 
  access management, transparent proxy pattern and others. To reserve ability to 
  patch possible bugs, the contract would be kept upgradeable (for a limited time, 
  and then locked afterwards). There are two roles initially defined: one is standard
  DEFAULT\_ADMIN role for managing upgradeability, and second is STABLE\_CONTROL role,
  for managing collateral and several numerical parameters (rebalance minimal threshold,
  flutter ratios).
  \item DAI stablecoin contract\textsuperscript{6}, as     
       DAI is used as metric of price and as part of the collateral.
  \item Uniswap V3 (universal V3 router\textsuperscript{7} and pool contracts)
       Uniswap is used extensively by USSD to measure peg, collateral ratio, 
       perform collateral buying and selling using swap routes (sometimes 2 or 3 pools
       in a swap chain). The pool swap path can be administered
\end{enumerate}
